* iii3. **Hypotheses**: There are several hypotheses which the authors document and validate/invalidate using the findings of the survey conducted in six countries - United States, England, New Zealand, China, Brazil, and Bulgaria)
  - **H1**: Internet shoppers seek more convenience than non-shoppers
  - **H2**: Internet shoppers report more innovative behavior than non-shoppers
  - **H3**: Internet shoppers are more risk averse than non-shoppers
  - **H4**: Internet shoppers will be more variety-seeking than non-shoppers

  - **H6**: Internet shoppers in China & Bulgaria were more brand conscious than non-shoppers. Results from other countries showed no significant differences between the two groups
  - **H7**: Internet shoppers were found to be more price-conscious in Brazil, China, New Zealand, and England but not for United States and Bulgaria
  - **H4**: Variety seeking behavious was found to be the exact opposite of price-consciousness

##Areas of improvement
* iv1. While measuring attitudinal variables, the authors expressed that there were concerns regarding potential conceptual and construct validity
* iv2. The authors also mention that their objectivity might have been compromised due to purposive sampling
* iv3. The study, even though it covers major regions of the world, is limited. Countries that belong to the same region may exhibit vastly different characteristics
