Two decades of Web application testing-A survey of recent advances, Information Systems, v.43 n.C, p.20-54, July 2014

## Keywords

1. **Software testing**: A technique used widely for quality assurance
2. **Web Applications**: A Web application is a system which typically is composed of a database (or the back-end) and Web pages (the frontend), with which users interact over a network using a browser

## Artifacts

1. **Motivational Statements**: The authors highlight that there is very limited work that has been caried out to survey the various recent advancements in the area of web application testing. 
The authors feel that due to various aspects of web applications like interoperability, security and, dynamics, the testing procedures used need to take these factors into account and must be surveryed accordingly.

2. **Related Work**: The authors mention that the only work they came accross related to this field has been that of Di Lucca and Fasolino on general approaches to Web application testing, and a survey by Alalfi et al. focussed on the modelling aspects of Web application testing which was an early review

3. **Results**: The authors identified the following types of testing techniques which are summarized as follows:

## Areas for improvement

The authors highlight the following areas for improvement
  1. Research can be done in the field of web application testing
  2. In the case of user session-based testing, the potential benefits of integrating user session data with traditional testing techniques have yet to be fully realised and requires further investigation 
  3. The techniques could also be extended to take into account concurrent user requests and keep track of Web application states
